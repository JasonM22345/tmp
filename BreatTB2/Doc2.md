🧠 Return Stack Behavior: Transitions & Underflow

The following Mermaid flowchart visualizes how return addresses are pushed/popped from the RSB and how underflow triggers RSBA fallback:

stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> RSB_Empty

    RSB_Empty --> Call1: call Gadget0
    Call1 --> RSB_1: Push ret@G0

    RSB_1 --> Call2: call Gadget1
    Call2 --> RSB_2: Push ret@G1

    RSB_2 --> Call3: call Gadget2
    Call3 --> RSB_3: Push ret@G2

    RSB_3 --> Call4: call Gadget3
    Call4 --> RSB_Full: Push ret@G3

    RSB_Full --> Ret1: ret
    Ret1 --> RSB_3

    RSB_3 --> Ret2: ret
    Ret2 --> RSB_2

    RSB_2 --> Ret3: ret
    Ret3 --> RSB_1

    RSB_1 --> Ret4: ret
    Ret4 --> RSB_Empty

    RSB_Empty --> Ret5: ret (underflow)
    Ret5 --> RSBA: 🔥 Fallback to RSBA / BTB

🏗️ Intel-Specific Behaviors

✅ RSB Stuffing
	•	When a context switch or syscall occurs, Intel CPUs (Skylake+) stuff the RSB with dummy entries to prevent predictable fallback.
	•	The entries often point to a benign address like #UD (undefined instruction trap).
	•	This prevents speculative execution from jumping to attacker-controlled gadgets after RSB underflow.

Before switch:
  RSB = [ret@User1, ret@User2, ret@User3, ret@User4]

After switch (with RSB stuffing):
  RSB = [ret@#UD, ret@#UD, ret@#UD, ret@#UD]

✅ IBPB (Indirect Branch Predictor Barrier)
	•	IBPB is a hardware fence that clears indirect branch predictors, including BTB.
	•	Used to stop cross-domain branch target leakage.
	•	Typically issued on:
	•	Kernel → userspace transitions
	•	Hypervisor → guest transitions
	•	Process context switches

Linux usage:

echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/ibpb_enabled  # for vulnerable microarchitectures

Assembly:

mov ecx, 0x49  ; MSR_IA32_PRED_CMD
mov eax, 1     ; IBPB request
xor edx, edx
wrmsr

💡 IBPB is not always enabled by default for performance reasons.
